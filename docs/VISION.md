# Vision: Open Source for Public Libraries

Libraries are champions of access, education, and equity. They are also chronically under-resourced when it comes to technology infrastructure. While the values of open source align closely with the mission of libraries, many public institutions face steep barriers to adoption â€” complexity, staffing limitations, and the perceived risk of transitioning away from proprietary software.

Just-So was built not just to solve a technical problem, but to lower one of those barriers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

To make open source software more approachable, practical, and maintainable in public library environments â€” starting with public-access workstations.

---

## ðŸ›  The Toolkit Philosophy

Just-So is part of a growing suite of tools designed specifically with libraries in mind:

- **Just-So** â€” Clean-slate home directory resets using Btrfs and systemd
- **Stations** â€” Automatically logs out users and displays on-screen countdown warnings for public computer sessions

Together, these tools form a practical foundation for managing Linux-based public computing environments without heavy administrative overhead.

## ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters

- **Cost Savings**: Open source software reduces licensing fees â€” funds that can be redirected to programs, staffing, or materials.
- **User Privacy**: Just-So ensures every patron gets a fresh session, free from data remnants.
- **Staff Empowerment**: Tools like Just-So and Stations reduce the need for deep Linux expertise to keep systems running smoothly.
- **Digital Equity**: By providing reliable, easy-to-use public computing environments, libraries help bridge the digital divide in their communities.

## ðŸ”­ Future Goals

- Provide reference images and deployment recipes for turnkey Linux public workstations
- Build a curated suite of scripts and tools to cover common library tech needs (printing, session control, kiosk mode, etc.)
- Document real-world examples of libraries using these tools successfully
- Encourage collaboration and sharing within the open source + library community

---

We believe libraries deserve tools that are as open, accessible, and community-driven as the values they promote.

Letâ€™s build them together.
